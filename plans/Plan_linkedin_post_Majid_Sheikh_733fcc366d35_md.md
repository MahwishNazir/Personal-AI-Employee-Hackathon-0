## Summary
Majid Sheikh posted a practical critique of common RAG implementation failures: raw unstructured documents, no metadata/filtering, poor chunking, no retrieval evaluation, no monitoring. High-quality, actionable content relevant to AI engineering audience.

## Action Checklist

- [ ] Note content quality: practical, high-signal post on RAG production pitfalls — aligns with AI engineering interests
- [ ] Engagement decision: Like + comment to amplify and build relationship with Majid Sheikh
- [ ] Draft comment: "This hits home. Retrieval quality really is the bottleneck. Would add: metadata filtering and hybrid search (semantic + keyword) are often the first quick wins to close the quality gap."
- [ ] Route comment through human-approval-workflow before posting
- [ ] Consider resharing with added commentary if it aligns with current goals in Business_Goals.md

## Original Post Summary
```
Most RAG systems fail in production. Not because of the model. Because of bad implementation.
Common mistakes: raw docs, no metadata, poor chunking, no retrieval eval, no monitoring.
RAG works — but only if built properly. Retrieval quality determines everything.
