Unread notification.

Majid Sheikh commented on Jon Ingi Ingimundarson's post: Fascinating concept! It’s like seeing the Aglets idea evolve into truly autonomous, evolving AI agents. Carrying identity, memory, and skills across environments opens up possibilities for continuous learning and adaptation, but also raises interesting challenges around security, trust, and governance. Excited to see where this goes.
