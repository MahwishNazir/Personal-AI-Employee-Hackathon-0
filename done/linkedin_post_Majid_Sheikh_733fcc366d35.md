Majid Sheikh posted: Most RAG systems fail in production. Not because of the model. Because of bad implementation. The common mistakes I see: • dumping raw documents without structure • no metadata or filtering • poor chunking strategy • no retrieval evaluation • no logging or monitoring Result? The AI gives inconsistent or incorrect answers. RAG works extremely well — but only if built properly. The model is just one piece. Retrieval quality determines everything.
