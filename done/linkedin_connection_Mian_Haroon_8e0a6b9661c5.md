MCP (Model Context Protocol) introduces a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools and services. Here are the core architectural components: 𝟭. 𝗠𝗖𝗣 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 The AI application (agent, chat app, assistant) that initiates tool calls. 𝟮. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 Defines a standard format for: • Tool discovery • Input/output schemas • Requests & responses • Authentication This ensures interoperability across systems. 𝟯. 𝗠𝗖𝗣 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿 Independent service that exposes tools in a standardized way and executes real business logic. 𝟰. 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 Where actual operations happen: • API calls • Database queries • SaaS integrations • Internal services 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝘆 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮: MCP decouples the AI model from tool implementations. Instead of tightly wiring tools inside your application, MCP enables a service-based architecture where tools are reusable, discoverable, and scalable. Tool Calling connects a model to a function. MCP connects a model to an ecosystem. As AI systems scale, protocol-level thinking becomes essential. #AI #LLM #MCP #AIArchitecture #GenAI #AgenticAI
