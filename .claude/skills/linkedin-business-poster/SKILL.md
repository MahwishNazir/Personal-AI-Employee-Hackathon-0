# LinkedIn Business Poster Skill

## Purpose

Turns the work done in each Silver Cycle into polished, business-aligned LinkedIn content.
Reads context from `Business_Goals.md`, recent `plans/Plan_*.md` files, and the
`done/` archive to craft posts that reflect real progress.

**Always routes through `human-approval-workflow` — never posts directly.**

**Silver Tier pipeline position:** Step 5 of 6 (LinkedIn-specific branch)

```
[plan-creation-workflow]  detects linkedin-post category
        ↓
[linkedin-business-poster]  ← YOU ARE HERE
        ↓
[human-approval-workflow]   creates APPROVAL_post_linkedin_*.md
        ↓  (human approves)
[mcp-action-handler]        posts via Playwright
        ↓
[dashboard-updater]
```

## Trigger Conditions

This skill is invoked when **any** of the following are true:
1. A task in `needs_action/` has `category: linkedin-post`
2. A task source is `linkedin` and the content is a request to post/share something
3. The Silver Cycle prompt explicitly requests a LinkedIn post
4. It has been 7+ days since the last successful LinkedIn post (auto-posting mode)

---

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Load business context

Read `Business_Goals.md` in full. Extract:
- **Mission statement** (1–2 sentences)
- **Current goals** (bullet list)
- **Target audience**
- **Tone** (e.g. professional, builder mindset)

If `Business_Goals.md` does not exist, create it with a prompt to the user:
```
Business_Goals.md not found. Please create it with:
  ## Mission, ## Current Goals, ## Audience, ## Tone
```
Then halt — do not generate a post without business context.

**Reference file:** `Business_Goals.md`

### Step 2 — Load recent work

Read the 3 most recently modified `plans/Plan_*.md` files.
From each, extract:
- Plan title (first `#` heading)
- Category
- Key phrases / action items (skip metadata lines like `**Category:**`)
- Any "completed" checklist items

Also scan `done/` for the 5 most recently completed task files and their categories.

**Script reference:** `.claude/skills/linkedin-poster/linkedin_poster.py` → `read_recent_plans()`

### Step 3 — Select post angle

Choose ONE of the following angles based on what's most relevant this cycle:

| Angle | When to use | Hook format |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Progress update** | New tasks completed | "Here's what we shipped this week..." |
| **Lesson learned** | Bug/research task completed | "I just learned something important about..." |
| **Feature reveal** | Feature task completed | "Just shipped: [feature name]..." |
| **Behind the scenes** | Process/automation task | "How I automated [X] using [Y]..." |
| **Question / engagement** | Low-activity cycle | "I'm building [X]. What would YOU add?" |
| **Tool spotlight** | MCP/watcher used | "This tool changed how I work: [tool]..." |

### Step 4 — Generate post draft

Compose the post using this structure:

```
[Hook — 1 punchy line, < 15 words]

[Context paragraph — 2–3 sentences: what you built/shipped/learned]

[Specific details — 2–4 bullet points using real content from plans/done/]

[Key insight — 1–2 sentences: the takeaway or lesson]

[Call to action — question or invitation to engage]

[Hashtags — 4–6, mix of broad (#AI) and niche (#FileBasedPipelines)]
```

**Rules:**
- No markdown bold (`**text**`) — LinkedIn renders it oddly on mobile
- No emoji unless they appear naturally (1–2 max)
- Post length: 800–1300 characters (sweet spot for engagement)
- Always mention a real artefact: a script name, folder, plan, or technique
- Tone must match `Business_Goals.md` → Tone field

**Script reference:** `.claude/skills/linkedin-poster/linkedin_poster.py` → `generate_post()`

### Step 5 — Sensitivity check

LinkedIn posts are always **sensitive** (public, irreversible).
Automatically flag `"sensitive": true` — never skip `human-approval-workflow`.

Additionally check for:
- Competitor mentions (flag as High risk)
- Salary / financial figures (flag as High risk)
- Internal project names not meant for public (flag as High risk)
- Client names without consent (flag as High risk)

### Step 6 — Route to human-approval-workflow

Call `human-approval-workflow` with:
```json
{
  "action": "post_linkedin",
  "draft": "<full post text>",
  "source_task": "<triggering task filename or 'scheduled'>",
  "risk": "medium",
  "context": "Generated by linkedin-business-poster from Business_Goals.md + recent plans"
}
```

The approval file will be created at:
```
Pending_Approval/APPROVAL_post_linkedin_<timestamp>.md
```

### Step 7 — Update dashboard

Call `dashboard-updater` with status `"pending approval"` and post title.

## Post Quality Checklist

Before routing to approval, verify:
- [ ] Hook is under 15 words and specific (not generic "excited to share...")
- [ ] At least one real project detail mentioned (script, folder, technique)
- [ ] Tone matches `Business_Goals.md` → Tone field
- [ ] No leaked internal/sensitive information
- [ ] Character count between 800–1300
- [ ] Hashtags are relevant (no spam hashtags)
- [ ] Call to action is genuine, not forced

---

## Scheduling Logic (Auto Mode)

Check `dashboard.md` → "Recent LinkedIn Posts" table for last post date.
If last post was 7+ days ago and there are completed tasks to write about,
generate a post automatically at the end of the Silver Cycle even without
an explicit `linkedin-post` task in `needs_action/`.
