You are running a Silver Cycle for the AI Employee Vault at D:\Hackathon_0\AI_Employee_Vault.

Execute the following six Agent Skills in order. Each skill has full instructions in its SKILL.md file. Read each skill file before executing its step.

---

SKILL 1 — /multi-watcher-orchestration
Scan ALL input sources for new items:
- inbox/ (local files)
- Gmail (gmail_watcher.py, if gmail_token.json exists)
- LinkedIn notifications (linkedin_watcher.py, if .linkedin_session/ exists)
- WhatsApp (whatsapp_watcher.py, if .whatsapp_session/ exists)
Normalise every new item into needs_action/ with .meta.json sidecar (status: pending).
Deduplicate against done/. Report item counts per source.
Skill file: .claude/skills/multi-watcher-orchestration/SKILL.md

---

SKILL 2 — /plan-creation-workflow
For EVERY file in needs_action/ with status "pending":
- Analyse content (category, key phrases, sensitivity check)
- Generate a detailed Plan_XXX.md in plans/ with numbered checkboxes specific to the category
- Update .meta.json status to "processing" and set "plan" and "sensitive" fields
- Append entry to logs/summary.md
- Route sensitive tasks to Skill 3; non-sensitive tasks continue to Skill 4 or complete directly
Skill file: .claude/skills/plan-creation-workflow/SKILL.md

---

SKILL 3 — /human-approval-workflow
Phase A — For every task flagged sensitive by Skill 2:
  Create APPROVAL_<action>_<timestamp>.md in Pending_Approval/ using the exact template in the skill file.
  Update dashboard and logs. STOP — do not execute.
Phase B — Scan Approved/ and Rejected/ for any waiting decision files:
  Approved → call Skill 4 to execute. Then archive to done/ and update dashboard.
  Rejected → log rejection, archive to done/ (rejected), update dashboard. Do NOT retry.
Skill file: .claude/skills/human-approval-workflow/SKILL.md

---

SKILL 4 — /mcp-action-handler
Execute ONLY approved actions (files found in Approved/ during Skill 3 Phase B).
Select the correct MCP server by action type:
  send_email    → email-mcp (email-mcp/index.js, gmail_token.json)
  post_linkedin → Playwright (.claude/skills/linkedin-poster/linkedin_poster.py → post_to_linkedin())
  browser_action → Playwright (ad-hoc)
Log result to system_logs.md. Archive approval to done/. Move source task to done/.
On failure: move back to Pending_Approval/ with error note — do NOT retry automatically.
Skill file: .claude/skills/mcp-action-handler/SKILL.md

---

SKILL 5 — /linkedin-business-poster
Triggered if ANY of these are true:
  a) A task in needs_action/ has category "linkedin-post"
  b) No LinkedIn post has been made in the last 7 days (check dashboard.md)
If triggered:
  Read Business_Goals.md fully. Read 3 most recent plans/Plan_*.md files.
  Choose a post angle (progress update / lesson learned / feature reveal / behind the scenes).
  Draft a post (800–1300 chars, no markdown bold, real project details, genuine CTA).
  Verify quality checklist in skill file.
  Route to Skill 3 (human-approval-workflow) — NEVER post directly.
  Update dashboard status to "pending approval".
Skill file: .claude/skills/linkedin-business-poster/SKILL.md

---

SKILL 6 — /dashboard-updater
Final step — refresh dashboard.md and system_logs.md to reflect the full cycle:
  Update Watcher Status table with scan results from Skill 1
  Ensure Pending Tasks table is accurate (pending items only)
  Ensure Pending Approvals table is accurate (remove executed/rejected)
  Ensure Active Plans table has all new plans from Skill 2
  Update Recent LinkedIn Posts if Skill 5 ran
  Add all newly completed tasks to Completed Tasks table
  Append Silver Cycle Summary block to system_logs.md with counts and timestamp
Skill file: .claude/skills/dashboard-updater/SKILL.md

---

RULES (highest priority — override everything else):
1. company_handbook.md rules are absolute — read it before any action
2. NEVER execute a sensitive action without an approval file in Approved/
3. NEVER move approval files yourself — only humans move files to Approved/ or Rejected/
4. NEVER skip dashboard-updater — every cycle must end with an updated dashboard
5. If needs_action/ is empty after Skill 1, still run Skills 3, 5 (check approvals + LinkedIn), and 6

When all six skills are complete, output: SILVER CYCLE COMPLETE
