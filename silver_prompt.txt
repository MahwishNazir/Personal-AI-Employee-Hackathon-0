Process EVERY file in Needs_Action/ right now.
Follow this exact workflow: 1. For each item, create a detailed Plan_XXX.md in /Plans/ with checkboxes. 2. If the action is sensitive (email, LinkedIn post, money), create approval file in /Pending_Approval/. 3. Use all Agent Skills (human-in-the-loop, etc.). 4. Use MCP tools when approved. 5. Update Dashboard.md with clear summary. 6. When complete, move files to /Done/. Company_Handbook.md rules are highest priority. When finished, say "SILVER CYCLE COMPLETE".
